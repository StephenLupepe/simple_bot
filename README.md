# simple_bot
A simple rule-based chatbot using Python

## General Overview
Simplebot is a simple rule-based chatbot that can respond to some simple text-based questions.

This chatbot was built in order to gain more experience using Python and regular expressions.

The chatbot analyses the user's input using regular expressions to check whether the input matches the criteria
for a certain regular expression. If a match is found, the chatbot will respond with one of a preset selection of answers
at random.

The chatbot itself is very simple, requiring only the re, random and time libraries.
